# fedlex-toolbox
A toolbox to get work with laws from fedlex.admin.ch - outputs json.

…under a MIT license, have fun.

# Known issues / todos
- Not all laws have the same structure - more debugging needed (e.g. UWG, DesG, KG as in the content folder)
- Levels (Abteilung-Titel-Abschnitt-A-I-1…) are not yet nested in the json
- Currently only viable in German - other languages will presumably have other locators in the html (e.g. "Kurztitel")
- Version of the law (date) is not yet parsed
